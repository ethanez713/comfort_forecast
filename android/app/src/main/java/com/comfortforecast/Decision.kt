/**
 * The recommendation engine — a faithful port of the Python backend's
 * decision.py. Pure (no I/O), so it's the natural seam for future smart-home
 * control: today it returns an [Action]; later a controller maps actions to
 * devices (thermostat, attic fan, window openers) without changing this logic.
 *
 * Opening windows is "free cooling": worth it only when outdoor air is cooler
 * than your target AND comfortable AND clean AND dry. Dew point (not relative
 * humidity) is the honest mugginess gauge.
